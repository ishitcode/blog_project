## Getting Started  

### Prerequisites  
Ensure you have the following installed:  
- Ruby (version x.x.x or later)  
- Bundler (`gem install bundler`)  
- Other dependencies as needed

### Installation  
1. Clone the repo:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/ishikajain0411/ruby_programs.git  
   ```  
2. Navigate to the project directory:  
   ```bash  
   cd ruby_programs  
   ```  
3. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash  
   bundle install  
   ```

---

## Usage  
Run any Ruby file using the following command:  
```bash  
ruby filename.rb  
```  

For interactive exploration, use the IRB console:  
```bash  
irb  
```

## System Dependencies  
- Ruby (version x.x.x or later)  
- SQLite/PostgreSQL (if database is used)  

---

## Database Setup  
For projects requiring a database:  
1. Create the database:  
   ```bash  
   rails db:create  
   ```  
2. Run migrations:  
   ```bash  
   rails db:migrate  
   ```

## Running Tests  
Run the test suite with:  
```bash  
bundle exec rspec  
```  
Ensure all tests pass before submitting contributions.

---

## Contributing  
We welcome contributions! To contribute:  
1. Fork the repository.  
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/YourFeature`).  
3. Commit changes (`git commit -m 'Add YourFeature'`).  
4. Push the branch (`git push origin feature/YourFeature`).  
5. Open a pull request.  

Please follow the repository's coding style and ensure all tests pass.
